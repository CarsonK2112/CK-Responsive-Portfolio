Here I have attempted to create a responsive portfolio that should be reactive when shrunk down to multiple screen sizes. I could not figure out how to add the images to the card that were relevant so for now placeholders are being used. Other than that I have attempted to use some creative leeway to design the sites as I would like them to be coloring/spacing wise.
